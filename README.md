# Enron Sentiment Analysis using NLTK

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of text data from the **Enron Sentiment Dataset**. The dataset is downloaded, extracted, and preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The preprocessing steps include tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and removing stop words using the **NLTK** library. The ultimate goal is to prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition and Extraction
- The **Enron Sentiment Dataset** is downloaded as a tar.gz file and extracted for further use.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- The dataset's text files are processed using **NLTK**, where tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are applied.
- **Stopwords** are removed, and the text is prepared for further analysis or training machine learning models.
